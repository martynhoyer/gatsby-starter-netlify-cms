## Our name explained

When we were thinking about starting this company we came across the original definition of a concierge. Not just a person in a hotel lobby making arrangements for guests, the concierge was an important part of running of medieval palaces.

They were in charge of lighting all the candles at dusk. The concierge walked the corridors during the dark hours to so residents and guests were able to move around safely. In the morning they extinguished the candles to avoid wasting expensive wax.

Although making arrangements for guests is part of what we do, we thought that the older definition better described what we do. We provide "light" to allow companies to go about their business.

Behind closed doors we maintain our enlightenment so you don't have to. Our services are commissioned only when required, just like the candle wax.

Corse is a word synonymous with motorsport meaning race or short trip. What we work on is often inherently short in duration.

And with that, Corse Concierge was born.
