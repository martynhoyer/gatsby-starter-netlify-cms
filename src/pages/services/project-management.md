We hold qualifications in project management and understand the unique environment in which motorsport projects take place.

Corse Concierge can also apply the philosophy of racing to project delivery in other industries. Our team are used to working to tight deadlines and budgets. We understand that sometimes things might not go to plan, but know the most important thing is how you react. Corse Concierge will always get you to your finish line.

Clear communication is important to us, and nowhere is that more critical than whilst managing client projects.

From co-ordinating company relocations and new product launches, we can take on individual assignments you can continue to focus on your day to day business.

Our experienced staff can also work in-house to provide project management support as and when you need it.
